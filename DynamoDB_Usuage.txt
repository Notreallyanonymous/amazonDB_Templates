The free tier for DynamoDB provides 25GB of storage, 
along with 25 provisioned Write and 25 provisioned Read Capacity Units 
(WCU, RCU) which is enough to handle 200M requests per month.

RCU and WCU measures the number of reads and writes (respectively) per second. 
However, for obvious reasons, doing a 10 byte read is not billed the same as a 
read of the entire database - one RCU is a read of up to 4KB, and larger 
reads are counted as multiple reads. WCU uses a smaller quantum (1KB). 
Another thing you should know is that an eventual consistency read counts as
half a RCU, and a transactional read counts as two RCUs.


if you provision (i.e., use "Provisioned" billing mode) 25 RCUs, but then
try to make 26 requests per second. Well, first of all, 25 is not a hard 
per-second limit but an average limit. Amazon will let you use 50 RCUs in one
second if you used 0 RCUs in the what its period is isn't public, 
but it is known that in the past Amazon got complaints that people were 
paying for 25 RCUs and weren't getting 25,000 reads over 1000 seconds, 
and they acted on these complaints and now you should be able to get 25 
reads per second on a long-term average.


Also please check pricing and cost in the region you will deploy
regions have different costs and prices at the time of writing
