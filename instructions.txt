This is an amazon dynamodb templates that allows you to quickly create tables in amazon db
There is a little bit of Ruby code that converts a csv file into batches of 25 which is the limit when pushing items into dynamodb
Add a chmod u+x to the deploy file and execute the batch write files by using the following command 
aws dynamodb batch-write-item --request-items file://batches/batch-009.json replace the 009 with the bacthes you want to upload if one at a time 
or you can place them from all in your cmd line terminal in a chain succession seperated by a space each to upload all at the same time
